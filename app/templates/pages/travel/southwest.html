    </div>
</div>
<div class="para-tex">
    <p>The approach into Las Vegas flies over acres of dark empty desert. There are no suburbs to provide clusters of
        light. No highways to cut a yellow incandescent line. Just miles and miles of empty desert. Then, you begin to
        see a glow behind the formless shadow of the Spring Mountains, and as you glide over the last peak, the sudden
        brilliance of a ten thousand neon lights come into view. </p>
    <p>You see the pyramid of the Luxor hotel, a mini Eiffel Tower, and a mock New York skyline. And as you land, you
        half expect a tuxedoed George Clooney to greet you at the gate and invite you to knock over a casino. </p>
    <p>But Las Vegas on the ground is quite different from Las Vegas in the air. </p>
    <p>There is no George Clooney. No Brad Pitt. No Frank Sinatra. Instead, the strip is filled with large men in
        oversized white t-shirts and snap backs, clutching jumbo sized to-go margaritas in one hand and their undersized
        girlfriends in the other. Imagine Myrtle Beach, but instead of sunburnt dudes in tank tops, its sunburnt dudes
        in Raiders jerseys.</p>
    <p>The city is like a malicious theme park, one where the focus is more on siphoning off your money than
        entertaining. It&#39;s a mob designed Disneyland, where the sidewalks naturally shuffle pedestrians into casinos
        and street performers trick drunk passerbys out of dollars.</p>
    <p>For me, it was to serve as the starting point for the real trip. I would be packing my entire life into a van and
        traveling through eight national parks en route to Denver. My trip would be as far from the luxury and
        indulgence of Vegas as possible. It would be a test of grit, and it would be one that I approached with a mix of
        excitement and dread. </p>

<div class="para-tex">
    <p>Driving through Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, with my entire life crammed into the back of a van,
        I felt wonderfully untethered from my normal life. I had enough food and water to last a week or two, and no
        where I had to be until April 16th. I could go quite literally anywhere and do almost anything. </p>
    <p>Inspired by overly romanticized instagram posts and YouTube videos, my girlfriend Megan and I had decided to rent
        a campervan to take on a two week road trip across the southwest. We were not campers. In fact, neither of us
        had been camping since we were kids. But we were both in our late twenties, and with the long yawning expanse of
        the rest of our lives staring at us, we felt it necessary to make adventurous memories while still young. </p>
    <p>We had planned for the trip to last two weeks, but due to a scheduling conflict, I ended up spending the first
        week alone. I would fly into Vegas, visit Zion, Bryce Canyon and Capital Reef, and then meet up with Megan in
        Grand Junction in route to Moab and the rest of the trip. </p>
    <p>And so it was that I found myself alone in the van teetering atop canyon edges as I barreled my way across Utah
        State Route 12 from Bryce Canyon to Capital Reef. The twenty dollar gas station aviators did little to protect
        my sunburnt eyes, and I was nursing a head ache from altitude sickness. </p>
    <p>But by this time, I was feeling a bit more secure in my ability to live out of the van. In the front, there was a
        drivers and passengers seat, with a forty pack of water between. Directly behind the front seats was the bed. I
        had bought a 60 dollar mattress topper and some cheap navy blue sheets from Walmart. That combined with the down
        comforter provided by the van company and battery powered string lights bought from Amazon created a remarkably
        comfortable sleeping quarters--ones that stood up well even to a twenty degree night in Bryce Canyon and snow in
        Great Dunes. </p>
    <p>In the far back, there was the kitchen. This consisted of an overhead light, a propane powered camping stove, and
        a solar powered fridge. It mostly served as a pancake/soup station for campsites that forbade wood fires. The
        outside of the van was covered in mural of a dragon guarding a treasure chest, and the van itself was called
        &quot;Dragon&quot; by the company. </p>
    <p>I must admit some of my favorite memories on the trip were the drives between parks, particularly the drive
        through Grand Staircase. This part of America is particularly empty. Driving between Vegas and Zion, I saw
        plenty of places to stop and get gas, and the same was true between Zion and Bryce, but between Bryce and
        Capital Reef, there was nothing. No exits, no roadside gas stations, no farms, no houses. Just desert, canyons,
        and a road.</p>
    <p>There was however a scenic turnoff where you could overlook a particular attractive vista of the sandstone
        canyons, and in this turnoff, there was a sign which well captured the feeling of driving through the empty
        expanse of the southwest, all alone in a van named dragon, quite well. It read:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You&#39;re looking out over some of the wildest lands in the United States. The last area to be mapped in the
            lower 48 states, this rugged region remains a sparsely loaded frontier.</p>
        <p>You&#39;re standing in the 1.9 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, where conserving the
            land&#39;s wild character is a top priority. These public lands don&#39;t just protect astounding scientific
            values. <strong>They safeguard one of the rarest natural resources of all--the opportunity for solitude-- in
                a landscape sculpted by wind, water, and time.</strong></p>

        <span class="border">ZION SHUTTLE SERVICE</span>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="para-tex">
    <p>Zion was not a success.</p>
    <p>I had only a day there, and it just so happens that on that day, Angel&#39;s Landing was closed for trail
        repairs. The other major trail, the Narrows was open but the gear for the trail was booked up. </p>
    <p>To enter and exit the park, you have to take a shuttle, and so I had found myself stuck in the park with six
        hours to burn until my return shuttle arrived. </p>
    <p>However, there was hope. On the way down, the shuttle driver told me that I could ask anyone from his company if
        there was room on their shuttle and then head back with them--an option I would certainly be taking advantage
        of. </p>
    <p>So I completed the available one mile hike and then returned back to the parking lot to catch a shuttle back. It
        was 11:40 and the next shuttles were set to leave at 12:00. I approached the driver and told him my situation
        and asked if there was room on his shuttle. </p>
    <p>He looked at me with surprise and disgust and said, &quot;Who told you that? Because that is a lie. We are not
        able to do that. You have to go back on your designated shuttle. We can&#39;t accommodate extra
        passengers.&quot;</p>
    <p>The night before was my first night in the van, and I had been unable to sleep. As a result, I did not really
        react to confrontation. I told him that the driver on the way down had told me that.</p>
    <p>&quot;Well what is his name? Was it Ted? I have been having some trouble with Ted. I don&#39;t like to be the
        enforcer, but I will be when necessary. Was he an older man? Younger?&quot;</p>
    <p>I told him that I supposed he was bit older and that he said he was retired.</p>
    <p>&quot;Sounds like Ted. Me and Ted will be having a conversation about lying to the customers when I get back to
        the office.&quot; I stared at him blankly. &quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;s not your fault. Go ahead and get in
        the front seat.&quot;</p>
    <p>I climbed up into the van and to my surprise, so did he. He started the engine, and we were off back to town,
        just me and him. </p>
    <p>&quot;You know, I have been having a lot of trouble with my coworkers.&quot; Just what I wanted to hear.
        &quot;None of them know how to take a joke. They think I am unprofessional.&quot; I nodded along and said
        something about the importance of a sense of humor. </p>
    <p>&quot;What is that you do?&quot;, he asked me. I told him that I was a computer scientist. &quot;Really? Me
        too!&quot; </p>
    <p>I asked him the obvious question of what exactly are you doing driving a van at noon on Tuesday if you are a
        computer scientist?</p>
    <p>&quot;Well, I guess I just love nature. I do computer science work at night. In fact, I was offered a six figure
        raise to go full time, but I said no, this is my passion.&quot; He patted the steering wheel of the van.
        &quot;It&#39;s great just to be out here in the park.&quot; I nodded. &quot;You know you don&#39;t talk
        much.&quot; I was afraid to be marked as the same as his humorless coworkers and explained that it was my first
        night camping last night, and as a result, I hadn&#39;t fallen asleep until five in the morning. </p>
    <p>&quot;Me too!&quot;, he said, &quot;I was up all night coughing. It got so bad that I was coughing up
        blood.&quot; This is not what you want to hear in the time of covid. Sensing my discomfort, he explained that it
        was because the air was so dry. &quot;So what do you do for fun?&quot;.</p>
    <p>This is a question that I have never known how to answer. I don&#39;t really have distinct hobbies per say. I
        enjoy flipping through Instagram and watching YouTube videos, but neither of those things are a <em>hobby.</em>
        I told him that I play video games. </p>
    <p>&quot;Me too! I used to be on the number two Call of Duty squad in the world back in the day. Do you play a lot
        of Call of Duty?&quot; I told him that I did not, but he had already decided it was time to throw a bunch of
        Call of Duty references at me. I nodded along, smiling and responding where I could. We were almost in town.
    </p>
    <p>I told him that he should get another covid test on account of coughing up blood. He told me that he would rather
        die than get covid, but fortunately, I did not need to think of a way to respond to that since we had arrived
        back in town.</p>
    <p>I later reiterated this story to my sister. She said, &quot;Well it sounds like he&#39;s just mirroring back
        whatever you tell him but bigger.&quot;</p>
    <p>In my tired, dazed state, I hadn&#39;t realized. </p>
    <p>I said that I was a computer scientist and suddenly so was he. I said I couldn&#39;t sleep, and now he is
        coughing up blood at night (despite not coughing at all on the drive). I like video games, and he just so
        happens to be the number two Call of Duty player in the world. </p>
    <p>I hadn&#39;t managed to go on any real trails in Zion, but I did manage to meet a compulsive liar and get in his
        van without hesitation. The trip was off to a good start. </p>
