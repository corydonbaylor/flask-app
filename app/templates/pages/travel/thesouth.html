    <p><span class="first-character">L</span>ouisiana is fiercely proud of its French heritage, or at least in maintaining the appearance of French heritage. Its signature dishes, Cajun and Creole, combine African flavors, local ingredients, and saucy French techniques into a cultural institution. The wrought iron  balconies of French colonials line streets with names like Toulouse, Dauphine, and Bourbon. At one end of Jackson Square sits Saint Louis Cathedral, a white triple steepled structure, reminiscent of a European castle, and at the other end, Cafe Du Monde, a famous tourist trap, dishing out long lines, beignets, and French coffee. </p>
    <p>I was staying in New Orleans for a long weekend with Michael Bunting, a friend of mine from work. We would be staying in HI Hostel at the top of the French Quarter, along Canal Street. We had come the weekend after Mardi Gras and found a city nursing a collective hangover. </p>
    <p>Signs of life remained however. The illicit bead trade continued after hours on Bourbon street, and past midnight the entire French Quarter devolved into what Michael described as a medieval morality play, with random fights and arguments between strangers, drunken women and men stumbling down piss covered roads, and constant interjections of street vendors, hawking tarot card readings. </p>
    <p>This presented sensory overload for two data scientists who largely did not drink anymore. </p>
    <p>However, the jazz clubs of Frenchman&#39;s street proved perfect. We went with a British fellow from our hostel named Adrian. He had been in town for the past week, and needed a rest from partying. All of New Orleans most famous jazz clubs line Frenchman&#39;s Street, and we stopped in a Maison first, listening to a retro Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll band play old classics. </p>
    <p>Part of the character of New Orleans comes from the flat out strange individuals it draws to it. Before we could enter, we dutifully presented proof of vaccination and ID to the bouncer. About fifteen or so into the set list, an old man in a dark purple pinstripe suit and fedora carrying a large staff, wrapped in beads, approached the doorman. The doorman meekly asked for proof of vaccination, while the old man, who we nicknamed the spirit of New Orleans, looked vacantly past him, and without acknowledging his request, wandered into the bar. </p>
    <p>He proceeded to stand uncomfortably close to a group of girls and lick his lips, before circling the bar once and exiting the club. On his way out, he signaled to the doorman that he wanted him to take his staff and stamp it on the ground. The doorman obliged and just like that, the spirit of New Orleans left. </p>
    <p>We followed him out and listened to a brass band play underneath a neon sign that read &quot;Willie&#39;s Chicken Shack&quot;. A small crowd began to form, and people began to dance.        </p>
    <p>Michael remarked that its was like we were in a Pepsi commercial. I couldn&#39;t help but agree.</p>
