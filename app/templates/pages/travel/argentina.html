<div class="para-tex">
    <p>I remember sitting down in a little cafe. It felt very bohemian, rustic even. It had nice wifi, and as I drank a
        cup
        of tea (I have a weak stomach, so I don&#39;t drink coffee), I read the news on my phone, feeling like in this
        San
        Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires, I had finally discovered the little hipster, bohemian enclave that I had
        hoped
        to find. </p>
    <p>I could see this as home. </p>
    <p>This is one of two potential locations where I suspect I got the worst food poisoning I had ever experienced in
        my
        life. The little bit of milk that I had put in my tea was the prime suspect, the other being a glass of orange
        juice
        I had ordered at the airport. I shall never know what did the deed. It is one of life&#39;s great mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>I had lost my only credit card the night before. I had left it in the cab that had taken me from the port to my
        hostel. There is no more disconcerting feeling than finding yourself suddenly disconnected from the financial
        system
        in a foreign country when traveling alone. You become hyperaware of how little cash you have on hand and even
        more
        aware of how much everything costs. </p>
    <p>That play money feeling you get when abroad is gone. </p>
    <p>You feel yourself searching for a reset button that doesn&#39;t exist. You are suddenly and nearly unredeemablely
        screwed. But redemption does exist, and it comes in the form of Western Union. Without my mother (aren&#39;t
        moms
        the best?) sending me money, I may very well have had to wander the streets of Buenos Aires for the next week,
        cashless, while I waited for my flight home.</p>
    <p>That feeling of disconnect pervades Buenos Aires as a whole. There are few cities that prompt the question of
        <em>why
            does this place even exist at all?</em> </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It’s not surrounded by sea and hills, like Hong Kong and Nagasaki, nor does it lie on a trade route along
            which
            civilization has navigated for centuries, like London, Paris, Florence, Geneva, Prague and Vienna. No
            traveler
            arrives in Buenos Aires en route to somewhere else. Beyond the city there is no somewhere else</p>
        <p><strong>From &quot;The Tango Singer&quot; by Tomás Eloy Martínez</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Buenos Aires is a bizarre place. The architecture is French; the people, Italian; and the language is Spanish,
        and
        all of it is positively in the middle of nowhere. I&#39;m sure that many Brazilians and Uruguayans would
        disagree,
        but outside of Montevideo, which feels like the younger, hippy brother of Buenos Aires, there are no great
        surrounding cities. There is no where to take the train or bus to. You are already at your destination. </p>
    <p>Tucked into the cold arid end of the southern part of the South American continent, there lies a
        turn-of-the-century
        South American Paris, frozen in time with it&#39;s resplendent beaux-art homes and gracious wide avenues. </p>
    <p>And it really does look like Paris, but it looks like Paris if things had gone <em>wrong</em> somehow. A Paris
        where
        perhaps the Soviets had taken over, and everything became a bit more drab and worn. Or a Paris where the people
        couldn&#39;t afford to stop the brutalist architectural invasion of the 1950s. Or a Paris where dictators and
        populists stripped the city of its wealth through bribes and corruption. </p>
    <p>And in many ways, Buenos Aires is that. The city was one of the richest in the world in until about the Great
        Depression, after which it swan dived into the middle income trap. </p>
    <p>Perhaps it was Peron, that proto-fascist-socialist-populist who has defined the past twentieth century in the
        country, who is the reason Buenos Aires is not considered one of the great cities of the world. </p>
    <p>My suspicion is that Argentina never properly industrialized. The country remains big in agribusiness. It eats
        the
        most beef per capita, as the tour guides will surely tell you. But farming isn&#39;t the path to enrichment
        anymore,
        as it was at the turn of the century. And as the tour guides will also tell you, somewhat dryly, Buenos Aires
        has
        already seen its best days. </p>

        <span class="border">NEW YEARS</span>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="para-tex">
    <p>There is only one universal holiday in the world, and that is New Years. New Years is in many ways the only
        <em>natural</em> holiday. At its most simple, our calendar has intervals called years, and thus we have a first
        day
        of each year, hence the holiday New Years. By the simple fact that we measure time, we are predestining
        ourselves to
        New Years holiday. </p>
    <p>Suffice it to say it, it is wonderful to be in another country on New Years because you know there will be a
        celebration. </p>
    <p>I had arrived in &quot;America del Sur&quot;, which was the name of my hostel on New Year&#39;s Eve. The hostel
        had
        planned a potluck for New Years where patrons could have a meet and greet over international food. </p>
    <p>In my room, I meet one of my three suite mates. He was a Brazilian man in his late twenties who pretty much
        immediately told me that his wife had recently left him and that he was traveling alone. English was not his
        first
        language, and he told me this in that matter-of-fact way that you convey language when you don&#39;t know enough
        words for nuance. </p>
    <p>We very wrongly assumed that we would be only ones dorky enough to bring food to the potluck. We settled on
        spaghetti
        and meatballs for dinner, with my roommate insisting that we add carrots to the red sauce. This ended up being,
        to
        my surprise, a good touch. </p>
    <p>The tiny hostel kitchen was packed that night. </p>
    <p>There were Belgian waffles, made by Belgians; eggs and bacon, made by Brits; Swedish bread cake, made by Swedes;
        and
        of course, our spaghetti, made by the Brazilians and myself. </p>
    <p>Our spaghetti took an inexplicably long time to prepare, so I missed almost all of the food; there was plenty
        more
        dishes than those described above, and about thirty to forty people crammed into the lobby. Fortunately, I did
        have
        a chance to try the Swedish bread cake. </p>
    <p>Swedish bread cake&#39;s name is both deceptive and honest. It&#39;s not a cake, even though it has that in the
        name
        and it does look like a cake. In truth, it&#39;s a sandwich dressed up like a cake, with layers of bread, smoked
        salmon, and egg salad, topped with ham and citrus. </p>
    <p>Frankly, it sounds and looks disgusting, which I assume, is why there was so much left. </p>
    <p>&quot;Do you like it?&quot;, asked one of the two Swedish girls who had made it. I responded that I loved the
        cake.
        &quot;Perfect,&quot; she said.</p>
    <p>Now I will pause right here to say the awkward truth. Every young man would like to have two attractive young
        Swedish
        women to make them bread cake, even if they don&#39;t know what bread cake is. And yes, there is a certain
        allure to
        being able to say that you spent the night chatting up two Swedish girls while traveling abroad. And yes, these
        all
        were all thoughts I had when I asked if they were going to see the fireworks later that night. </p>
    <p>I feel no shame in these things. </p>
    <p>We walked down to Puerto Madero, which is the upscale modern district of the city. It is small, thin neighborhood
        set
        against the banks of the Rio del Plata, with big glass skyscrapers, a distinct contrast to the plaster and stone
        Parisian designs of the rest of the city. A twenty-something Saudi man, who was walking with us, said that this
        is
        the type of city he likes to go to. I remember thinking it looks like how I would imagine Tampa Bay would look.
    </p>
    <p>We counted down to the New Years and drank champagne and wine as the fireworks exploded over the port.
        Afterwords, an
        excitable British man asked me if I wanted to go clubbing with his friends in Palermo, which is the trendy part
        of
        the city. I declined and instead walked the Swedish girls home. </p>
    <p>We stopped on the Plaza del Mayo, which is the central plaza that contains the Pink House, the Argentine version
        of
        the White House. I told them about how this plaza once had been filled with clamoring Argentines hoping to get a
        peak of Eva and Juan Peron. They told me that they were going on a road trip through all of South America and
        that
        this was their second month abroad. </p>
    <p>I was impressed by this, and we created a group thread on instagram, which I named &quot;Swedish Meatballs&quot;.
        They invited me to go skydiving, but I declined, as not even the allure of two Swedish women and all the bread
        cake
        I could eat would get me to jump out of a plane. </p>
