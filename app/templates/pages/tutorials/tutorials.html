            <p>
                Well start here. In this series of tutorials, we will cover how to first build a
                static website using just HTML and CSS. Then we will add in bootstrap,
                which is a CSS framework. Then we will cover how to add in a backend using flask.
                This will make our website signficantly easier to maintain and update.
                Finally, we will go over how to host your website on a raspberry pi, so
                that other people can access your website!
