    <h3> Web Development </h3>
    <p><strong>So how did I go about building this site?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>From a techincal perspective, this site was built using flask as a backend and boostrap 4 as a CSS framework.
        I am hosting my website on a raspberry pi I bought that is running apache and linux. So the web stack for this
        is a LAMP stack without the PHP or mySQL (thus far). Its a LAF stack.
    </p>
    <p>As far as adding content, I typically write out tutorials and the like in Typora, which is a
        markdown editor for Mac OS and export them as unstyled HTML. I have found this process to be
        quite seemless and fun. The ulimate goal here is to try out different things and put all the resources
        that I had needed in one place for the next guy.

                Well start here. In this series of tutorials, we will cover how to first build a
                static website using just HTML and CSS. Then we will add in bootstrap,
                which is a CSS framework. Then we will cover how to add in a backend using flask.
                This will make our website signficantly easier to maintain and update.
                Finally, we will go over how to host your website on a raspberry pi, so
                that other people can access your website!
